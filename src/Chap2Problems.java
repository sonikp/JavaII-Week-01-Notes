		 * 2.1 Computer science concepts
		 * 
		 * What is an object?		  
		 * Objects are persons, places, things that do an action in a situation or are acted upon
		 * 
		 * What is a class?		 
		 * A class in Java tells the computer what data we expect objects of that class to have, and what they can do
		 * 
		 * What is a type? Why are types important?
		 * A type is a description of the "kind of" thing something is. A data type specifies the size and type of value 
		 * that can be stored in an identifier. It also determines how many bits are used to represent the value and how 
		 * the bits are interpreted by the computer.
		 * - Primitive: integer, char, boolean, floating point,
		 * - Non-primitive: classes, interfaces, arrays
		 * 
		 * What is casting? What is it used for?
		 * Casting is taking an existing data type and transforming it to another data type. It tells 
		 * the compiler to change a value to a particular type even if it could lead to a loss of data.
		 * 
		 * What is a variable? When do you need one? What are the differences between object variables and primitive variables?
		 * A variable is a data element that is a data type and a data size which is physically located in memory of the computer.
		 * A variable is used to represent data. Primitive variables are variables that are declared of any of the primitive 
		 * data types, integer, char boolean, floatingPoint. Object variables are any other type. 
		 * 
		 * What is garbage collection?
		 * Garbage collection is the process where the JVM keeps track of the space being used by the application, and once space 
		 * is no longer used, it is returned to the system.
		 * 
		 * What are relational operators?
		 * Operators that allow the comparison of one data element or expression to another. greater/less than == / !=
		 * Maths operator is a + - / *
		 * 
		 * What is a string?
		 * A string is a sequence of characters. In java a string is an object.
