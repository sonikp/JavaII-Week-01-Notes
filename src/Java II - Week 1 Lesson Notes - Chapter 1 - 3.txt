Chapter 1

Introduction:

- A program or algorythm is like a recipe.
- Fundamentally, compyters are encoding/decoding machines
- Moore's law: the number of transistors on a chip doubles every two years.
- Initially stated to be 12 months, then extended to 18 months, and finally it was extended to 2 years
- Computer Science is the study of process. Process is important to nearly every field, from biz to science to law
- Software is nothing but applied metaphysics, following this list of questions:
	- What is identity?
	- What is an object?
	- How and when are objects created and destroyed?
	- What do my objects mean and why?
	- How do my objects discover each other?
	- What are the abstractions that are shared by my objects?
- Learning mainly to maniplate media

- Emergence: is a fascinating phenomenon that spontaneously manifests within nature as well as within complex software systems.
- The ramifications of the emergence phenomenon may tell us a great amount about how consciousness has evolved, and may help us learn how to create more interesting virtual worlds

DrJava - Your Principal IDE

	- Has an interactions pane. This pane allows you to issue Java statements that are executed imediately as part of an interactive dialog with an underlying Java interpreter
	- Immediate feedback
	- This helps to address a common problem with online courses, namely: "how do students get feedback so that they can know they are on track"
	- To get most out of the of the course, you must use DrJava

Classes and Objects:
	- Classes are Object factories - with a Class, you can create any number of Objects from it.
	- The Class defines the details of the structure and the behavior associated with the Objects that it creates
	- One analogy often used to explain the relationship between a Class and the Objects it creates is the process of making cookies:
		- To make cookies, one rolls out the cookie dough into a flat surface
		- The cookie cutter is like a Class
		- the stamped-out cookies are like Objects created from that Class

Types and Casting
	- What's a data type? "Data Type" is fundamental to understanding how to program
	- There are 2 important aspects to any given data type:
		- 1. Size - How much memory is set aside (allocated) to be used by the data of that data type?
		- 2. Encoding Scheme - How will the bits in memory be interpreted based on that data type?
	- Whereas size deals with the implementation details of "how much space is needed to manage the data", the encoding scheme deals with the semantics (meaning) of the data residing in that space 


Data Type: 
	Float;
	- 32 bits, representing floating point decimal values
	Double;
	- same as floats, but 2x the size (64 bits)
	(fewer bits =  narrower data type, greater number of bits is wider)
	Int;
	- size of 32 bits. Literal values are literal values of the number assigned to the int variable
	Examples of numeric literals:

	System.out.println(42 / 5);	displays 8 since operands are int values
	System.out.println( 42.0 / 5.0); displays 8.4 since operands are float values

	Long; 
	- 64 bit, 2x the size of int

	Char:
	- character data type, size is 16 bits.

	Boolean;
	- true or false

Casting:	
	- representing one number cast as a different data type

	System.out.println((double) 42 / 5); displays 8.4 since 42 is explicitly cast as a double


Relational Operators:

	==	is equal to
	!=	is not equal to
	> 	is greater than
	<	is less than
	>=	is greater or equal to
	<= 	is less or equal to


Primitives

	- int, long, float, double and char are called primitive data types
	- They are rudimentary data types and are not true objects

String

	- is a sequence of characters
	- String is an objects
	- String literals are denoted through the use of ""
	e.g System.out.println("Java");

String Concatenation
	- System.out.println("Java " + "rocks!"); // output is Java rocks!, creates a new string object that is a fusion of the previous two data elements

Variables and Memory Maps
	- Variables means having a name in memory that holds a value of a specific data type

Naming convension:	CamelCase

Memory Maps
	- memory is laid out as a series of contiruous bytes
	- 

Objects are dealt with differently
	- Variables that serve as names for Objects are called reference variables, since theyrefer to the Object that the name
	- Reference variables hold values that point or refer to the position in memory where the Object exists

	String message = "Strings are true Objects!";

	...declares a reference variable named message that refers to a String Object

	System.out.println(message);

	... dispalys Strings are true Objects!

	- The memory map view of how reference variables work looks like this

	message => (32 - bit address value), of the location where the actual value of the string is stored


Naming:

	- variables, methods, classes, objects, packages, and programs
	- Naming is an "abstraction"
	- Abstractions help us manage complexity

Method:
	- A way of doing something
	- is a set of one or more statements and are executed in sucession
	- Two categories of methods
		- 1. Class methods
		- 2. Object methods
	- Class methods:: belong to the Class in which they are defined
	- Object methods belong to each Object instantiated from a given class
	- the generak syntax for involing a Class method is:

	ClassName.methodName();

	System.out.println(Character.getNumericValue('Z'));  		// displays 35 representation of Z

	- To invoke a Class method you do not need to have an Object instantiated from that Class. Remember: Class methods belong to the class, not to the Objects created from that Class.

Object Methods: (Slide 37)

	- The general syntax for invoking a Object method is:

	objectReference.methodName();

	Example:

	String message = "Strings are true Objects!";

	String lowerMessage = message.toLowerCase();


The CLASSPATH  (slide 39)
	- delimited set of pathnames that the Java compiler searches to find the classes that need to be loaded


Defining Classes and Creating Objects (Slide 40)
	- need to get latest java libraries from web site

Defining Classes and Creating Objects

	- The general syntax for creating an onject is:

	new ClassName(parameterList);

	Example

	System.out.println(newWorld());

	...displays A 640 X 480 workd with 0 turtles in it:

	Else do the same:

	World world = new World();		// Creates a World and assigns to world
	System.out.println(world);

Up to Slide 42

	Turtle fred = new Turtle(world);			// new Turtle(world)
		
		- creates a turtle object, new Turtle(), Turtle is a classname. We pass in a parameter, the 'world' reference variable from above. 
		We created a world and assigned the reference value to that world to a reference variable, and pass that reference variable as a 
		parameter, and a turtle object is created. The reference variable associated to that Turtle object will be 
		assigned to the reference variable fred, which is of type = Turtle, which is the Turtle object.
		
		
	Turtle george = new Turtle(20, 40, world);
	
		- create another new Turtle object, which passes in 3 parameter, 2x number values, and a reference variable. This creates a Turtle object with the 
		world reference variable, and 2x location parameters, x,y. This is the assigned to reference variable "george" which is of type=Turtle
		
	Sending Messages to Objects:
	
		- now have two turtle objects in our world object, therefore using reference variables can actually talk to both these objects individually.
		
		Statements:
			fred.setName("Fred the great");	// references object fred, and invokes method setName, and assigns "Fred the great" to the name variable for the fred object
			george.setName("King George");	// references object george, and invokes method setName, and assigns "King George" to the name variable for the george object
			fred.forward(); 	// references object fred, invokes the method forward, and provides 50 units to the forward() method to advance the fred object forward by 50 units.
			System.out.println(fred.getName()); invokes the getName method for fred and calls this name parameter, which is the printed to the screen using the System.out.println method
			
Assignment - Slide 44	both for:

	drawSquare();
	drawRectangle();		
			
			
	
	
	Object References and Primitives
	
		- object references are different from primitives
		- primitives:
			char, byte, int, short, long, float, double & boolean
			primitive example:
				int x;
				x = 5;
				
		- object references are variables that refer to true objects, and as such
		invoke methods upon (send messages to) the objects they refer to.
		Object Reference example;
			String courseName = "Java II";
			courseName.toUpperCase();
		
		Object References can invoke methods, whereas Primitives cannot
	


	Backslashes and slashes	(slide 49)
	
		- backslashes are use with String literals to denot an escape sequence
			\t	-	tab
			\n	-	new line
			\r	-	return
			\\	-	backslash
		
		- When trying to denote a backslash character in a file pathname use
		the forward / instead.
		
	**Page 43 lesson notes**
	
	1.3 Classes and Objects
	
		- Objects contain both 
			- Data (using variables)
			- Instructions (using methods)
			
		- A method that appears for each object is called an "instance method"
		
	Determining how to perform a programming task:
	
		- write it down in English as a sequence of steps to be performed
		- SEPARATION OF CONCERNS: Separate WHAT to do from HOW to do it		
		- STEPWISE REFINEMENT: consists of a series of steps, refining part of the task
		into more detailed steps, some in English, some in Java
		- 
			
	Three kinds of Methods
	
		- calls to functions are expressions and produce values
		- calls to procedures are statements and do not produce values, instead they perform a
		task
		- constructor; the only purpose is to assign initial values to fields in a folder when
		folder is created
		- is same as; assign initial values to variables and methods when a method is created
		
		
	Objects of class String
	
		- a String is a class and String value is the name of an object

	1.3.5 Key Concepts
	
		- Class: a class is a file drawer of folders
		
		- Instances & Objects: folder, instance and object are used interchangably
		
		- Procedures, functions, constuctors: 3 types of methods. A call to a:
			- procedure: performs a task but does not produce a value
			- function: produces a value
			- constructor: initializes some/all fields of a newly created object
			- method call can have arguments, which are expressions
			- value of arguments are used in some fashion when a method is called
			- the specification of the method explains how they are used
			
		- New-expression: new className(arguments); creates a new object of the class,
		initializes its fields by calling constructor className and yields as its value
		of the newly created object
		
		- Class as a type: class name may be used as a type, and variable declared with that
		type can contain the name of a folder "class" of that type.
		
		- Null: represents absence of the name of an instance
